# Contributing to TableCheck

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to TableCheck open source packages, which are hosted in
the [TableCheck Organization](https://github.com/tablecheck) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your
best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [TableCheck Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!

We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/tablecheck/spa-boilerplate/discussions) for questions, head over there
and ask away! If you're unsure if you have a question or a bug, start with a discussion.

## What should I know before I get started?

This repository is primarily for facilitating the setup of demos, prototypes and experiments that we use internally at
TableCheck Inc.
We are happy to accept bug reports and bug fixes but any feature requests/enhancements will need to be discussed by our
internal Frontend team.
This may take some time so please be patient 🙇

## How can I contribute?

Helpful contributions are fixing and reporting bugs or suggesting improvements. When reporting a bug please ensure that
you include as much information as possible and if possible include a repository to replicate the bug in.

## Code styling

Our code style is entirely handled by prettier and eslint. Make sure that the linter and tests pass before submitting a
Pull Requests. If they don't pass, we won't fix them or merge the pull request.

## Releasing

Our releases are automatic. Once a Pull Request is merged, the CI will automatically release a new version to the demo
URL.
